# Learn Natural Language Processing with Python

This course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python. By the end of the course, you will be familiar with a variety of NLP techniques, and you will be able to work with text and PDF files, use regular expressions for pattern searching, perform tokenization using Spacy, and much more.

## What I'll learn:

- Working with Text Files in Python: Learn how to read, write, and manipulate text files using Python.

- Working with PDF Files in Python: Learn to extract and manipulate data from PDF files using Python.

- Regular Expressions: Understand the usage of regular expressions for pattern searching in text.

- Tokenization with Spacy: Use Spacy, a powerful Python library for NLP, for ultra-fast tokenization.

- Stemming and Lemmatization: Learn these fundamental NLP techniques for reducing words to their root form.

- Vocabulary Matching with Spacy: Match and compare vocabularies using Spacy.

- Part of Speech (POS) Tagging: Use automatic POS tagging to process raw text files.

- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Understand the technique of recognizing named entities in text.

- Visualizing POS and NER with Spacy: Learn how to visualize your POS and NER results using Spacy.

- Text Classification with SciKit-Learn: Use the popular machine learning library SciKit-Learn for text classification tasks.

- Topic Modelling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation: Understand and use this technique for identifying topics in a collection of documents.

- Non-negative Matrix Factorization: Learn about this alternative approach to topic modelling.

- Word2Vec Algorithm: Use this powerful tool to train your own word embeddings.

- Sentiment Analysis with NLTK: Understand sentiment in text using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

- Building a Chatbot with Deep Learning: Utilize Deep Learning techniques to build your own intelligent chatbot.
